excerpt: 'The importance of data charts is self-evident, given their ability to express complex data in a simple format that facilitates quick and easy comparisons, analysis, and consumption. However, the inherent visual nature of the charts creates barriers for people with visual impairments to reap the associated benefts to the same extent as their sighted peers. While extant research has predominantly focused on understanding and addressing these barriers for blind screen reader users, the needs of low-vision screen magnifer users have been largely overlooked. In an interview study, almost all low-vision participants stated that it was challenging to interact with data charts on small screen devices such as smartphones and tablets, even though they could technically “see” the chart content. They ascribed these challenges mainly to the magnifcation-induced loss of visual context that connected data points with each other and also with chart annotations, e.g., axis values. In this paper, we present a method that addresses this problem by automatically transforming charts that are typically non-interactive images into personalizable interactive charts which allow selective viewing of desired data points and preserve visual context as much as possible under screen enlargement. We evaluated our method in a usability study with 26 low-vision participants, who all performed a set of representative chart-related tasks under different study conditions. In the study, we observed that our method signifcantly improved the usability of charts over both the status quo screen magnifer and a state-of-the-art space compaction-based solution.'

The importance of data charts is self-evident, given their ability to express complex data in a simple format that facilitates quick and easy comparisons, analysis, and consumption.
